# html-registration-form

Beginner friendly project on freeCodeCamp. This project was created using HTML and CSS. I have gone back over simple tasks to grasp a better understanding on topics that I went through at DevMountain and Thinkful. I learned how to control what types of data users can type into this form, and new CSS tools for styling a page to make it more user friendly.
